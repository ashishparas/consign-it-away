    PROP 65 NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
    California Proposition 65 requires that special warnings be provided when products contain chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm if the use of those products may cause exposure to those chemicals above specific limits.  It is the Seller’s sole responsibility to insure that its User Content complies with California Proposition 65.  Further information regarding California Proposition 65 may be obtained online by visiting www.p65warnings.ca.gov.  Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1789.3, ConsignItAway.com provides users of the Website with the following notice: You may report complaints to the Consumer Information Division of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at 800-952-5210.
     
     
     
     
     
    SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY
    The California Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB-657) requires certain retailers and other businesses doing business in California to disclose to the public their efforts, if any, to ensure that the goods they sell are not made by workers who are enslaved, or otherwise forced into service, or who have been the victims of human trafficking. ConsignItAway.com does not condone or intentionally support human trafficking, slavery or any other form of forced labor.  ConsignItAway.com requires its Sellers to adhere to labor and workplace standards that include employment of workers above the minimum working age who freely choose to work and who are regularly, legally compensated. We also require our Sellers doing business in California to warrant that any products were made in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws prohibiting child labor, forced labor, and unsafe working conditions. However, ConsignItAway.com does not currently require its Sellers to provide any additional certification regarding compliance with slavery and human trafficking laws nor do we regularly engage in audits of our professional suppliers’ factories to verify their compliance with our standards (although we continue to evaluate the feasibility of conducting audits).  ConsignItAway.com maintains internal accountability standards for employees and contractors, and we will not tolerate slavery or human trafficking by either. ConsignItAway.com does not currently provide any specific training for its personnel responsible for supply chain management with respect to human trafficking and slavery and methods for mitigating risks. However, ConsignItAway.com reviews all of its policies and procedures, including training practices, on a regular basis and will continue to consider the appropriateness of expanding its training offerings.
     
    RELEASE AND INDEMNITY
    If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
     
    If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

    You agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party.
    ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
    Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, Seller Terms or the Privacy Policy, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Arbitration is a process established by law that allows parties to a transaction to agree to resolve their Disputes by an independent arbitrator, rather than by a judge and jury. In an arbitration, only the arbitrator hears the evidence presented by both sides and makes a decision that is final and binding on the parties. The arbitrator may award damages and provide other relief as provided by law. By agreeing to arbitrate any Disputes with us, you agree to give up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights under this Agreement and with respect to any Dispute, You and ConsignItAway.com expressly delegate to the arbitrator the authority to determine the arbitrability of any Dispute, including the scope, applicability, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the requirement to arbitrate. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.  Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days’ advance written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. ConsignItAway.com will provide such notice by email to your email address on file with ConsignItAway.com and you must provide such notice by email notice@ConsignItAway.com. During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Dispute. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.   To begin an arbitration proceeding with AAA, you must follow the steps outlined by AAA at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRulesWeb.pdf. To begin an arbitration proceeding with AAA, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: ConsignItAway.com Inc. Attn: Legal Notices, 1522 South Glenstone Avenue, Springfield, MO 65804, United States of America.  AAA’s rules are also available at www.adr.com. If permitted by AAA, you may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  All aspects of any arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.  The locale for any in-person arbitration proceedings shall be in Greene County, Missouri or as is close thereto as possible. 
     
    WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTIONS AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS
    All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis, not on a class action or other consolidated basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the Dispute with the same remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not be joined with, or otherwise affect, any other Dispute. You and ConsignItAway.com agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their respective individual capacities and in so doing you and ConsignItAway.com hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration (either as a named-plaintiff or class member), and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act. The terms of the Arbitration Agreement provisions shall survive after this Agreement terminates or your use of the Sites ends. Except as set forth above, if any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement.
