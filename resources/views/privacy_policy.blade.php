         <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
         <p>At ConsignItAway.com, we believe that you have a right to know what information we collect from you, and we want you to understand our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to our website, applications, or website features you use or access (collectively, the “Sites”), as well as any mobile application (each, an “Application” and together with the Sites and Applications, are referred to as the “Services”).</p>

         <p>By using our Services, you agree to the use, disclosure and procedures this Privacy Policy describes, which is incorporated into our <a href="https://www.thredup.com/legal/tou">Terms of Use</a>.  Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services (each, a “TPS”), such as EBay, Facebook Marketplace, Pinterest, Walmart, Amazon, Etsy, Google, Instagram, or other social network services and commercial partners of ConsignItAway.com. We are not responsible for their practices, content, or privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any TPS so that you know how they will use and share your information.</p>

         <h3>1. INFORMATION COLLECTED OR RECEIVED</h3>
         <p>We collect your personal information in order to provide and continually improve our Services.</p>
         <p>Personal information we may collect from you includes but is not limited to:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Your name, shipping address, receiving address, billing address and email address when signing up to create an account</li>
           <li>Your tax exempt status, if applicable. </li>
           <li>Your credit or debit card information. </li>
           <li>Identifier and other technical information, such as your browser information, operating system information, device information, IP address, and the date, time, length of stay and specific pages accessed during your interactions with the Services</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>We maintain one or more databases to store your personal information and may retain it as reasonably required to serve you and operate the Services. Personal information that we collect depends on how you use the Services. Providing your personal information to us is your choice. If you choose not to provide us with certain personal information, you may not be able to take advantage of many features of the Services.</p>

         <p>We may aggregate your personal information with information collected from other users to (i) provide you with a better experience,  (ii) improve the quality and value of the Services and (iii) analyze and understand how our Services are used.</p>

         <p>ConsignItAway.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children’s products for purchase by adults. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. If you have questions concerning our practices, please email us at: <a href="customerservice@ConsignItAway.com">customerservice@ConsignItAway.com</a>. </p>

         <h3>2. HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h3>
         <p>We may collect your information in the following ways:</p>
         <h4>WHEN YOU PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT OR MAKE A PURCHASE</h4>

         <p>If you use our Services to create an account to make sales or make a purchase, we may request certain personal information from you to facilitate the transaction. We may collect certain financial information from you, such as your credit or debit card information. We store only a very limited portion of your credit or debit card information, in a manner that is generally permitted by credit or debit card issuers. Our payment processing partner stores and processes your credit card or other payment information using industry-standard security measures. By making a purchase through the Services, you give us consent to use and provide your financial information as we consider necessary to process the transaction.</p>

         <h4>COMMUNICATIONS YOU INITIATE WITH US</h4>
         <p>If you contact us in person, by phone, email, instant message, live chat, social media, or by some other means (either through our Services or through TPS), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence for later reference. When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to figure out how to deliver more delightful and helpful emails and improve our Services.</p>

         <h4>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>
         <p>If you create your ConsignItAway.com account by connecting through a TPS, such as Amazon or Facebook, you are authorizing us to use public information from that connected account to help complete your ConsignItAway.com profile. We collect and store this information and use it to help you connect to our Site. Connecting your ConsignItAway.com account to a TPS is completely optional, and you will have the opportunity to grant permission when you attempt to connect. Please remember that the manner in which the TPS uses, stores, and discloses your information is governed solely by the policies of such service. We recommend that you review the terms and policies of that TPS, including its privacy and data gathering practices. ConsignItAway.com shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any TPS or any other third-party site or service that may be enabled within the Service.</p>

         <p>ConsignItAway.com partners with TPS who set cookies and tracking pixels for Site visitors and members on our behalf in order to deliver their services. These services include targeted online marketing and analysis of data collected through cookies. These TPS technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you visit ConsignItAway.com.com or other sites that also utilize the TPS, but do not allow access to personal information from ConsignItAway.com. TPS may choose to include ConsignItAway.com widgets on their sites. When you load a site that has chosen to include our widgets, we receive analytics information through a cookie that may be used to enhance our data or to improve our Services. ConsignItAway.com does not have access to or control over these TPS technologies, and they are not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>

         <h4>INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT</h4>
         <p>Like most websites, our Services may incorporate technology such as “pixel tags”, “web beacons” and “cookies” which allow us to track the actions of users of our Services. Pixel tags or web beacons are tracking devices on websites or in emails that can monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the email. Cookies are small files placed on your computer that recognize you when you return to ConsignItAway.com and that allow us to customize your user experience and improve the ConsignItAway.com service. You may modify the cookies that are accepted by your computer by changing your browser settings, although this may change the way the ConsignItAway.com website is presented to you. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and we have no obligation to inform you of third-party cookies that are set.</p>

         <p>As an example, ConsignItAway.com uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and for other personalized experiences. We also use tracking technology to create remarketing audiences of users based on visitor behavior on our Sites. ConsignItAway.com may also deliver custom ads based on your affinities, interests, geographic and demographic signals. In particular, ConsignItAway.com may use other TPS or services such as Google Analytics to monitor activity on the Site and to assist with advertising. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.</p>

         <h4>OPTING OUT</h4>
         <p>If you decide you do not want to receive marketing emails, you can select to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions in the email. Unsubscribing will stop you from receiving most types of communication, but it may not apply to emails about orders or transactions you place through the Services or to respond to your specific request, such as password recovery.</p>
         
         <h4>BLOGS, REVIEWS AND TESTIMONIALS</h4>
         <p>The Services may from time to time offer publicly-accessible blogs, customer reviews or testimonials. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blogs, customer reviews or testimonials, please contact us at: <a href="customerservice@consignitaway.com">customerservice@consignitaway.com</a>. Please note that in some cases we may be unable to remove your personal information.</p>

         <h3>3. HOW INFORMATION IS USED</h3>
         <p>We primarily use the information we collect to enhance the Services and your experience. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, as described below, we do not sell your personal information to anyone. If we share your personal information, we do so as described below.</p>

         <p>We may share your personal information with TPS providers, commercial partners, service providers, and others we conduct business with to: (i) enhance our Services and evaluate the effectiveness of our partnerships; (ii) provide you with additional services related to our Services; (iii) conduct quality assurance testing; (iv) facilitate creation of accounts; (v) provide technical support; (vi) market the Services; (vii) facilitate business partnerships with trusted partners and/or (viii) to provide other services to ConsignItAway.com.</p>

         <h4>AGENTS</h4>
         <p>Generally, we will not disclose your personal information to an unaffiliated third-party. However, we may provide your personal information to our employees, contractors, commercial partners, agents, service providers and designees (“Agents”) to enable them to perform certain services for us including without limitation: order fulfillment, payment processing, Clean Out Bag processing, website-related services such as web hosting, database management, improvement of website-related services and features, maintenance services and distribution of offers, business partnerships, partner promotions, advertisements and other marketing materials on our behalf.</p>

         <p>We may also provide our Agents with non-identifying or aggregate information indicating the demographic information of users on our Website, buying behavior, and opportunities to market to select segments of our users indirectly. When we share non-identifying or aggregate user data, it is done in a way that it cannot be linked with your personal information.</p>

         <h4>HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h4>
         <p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature to signal that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. This Site does not comply with Federal DNT legislation.</p>

         <h4>USE OF SERVICES VIA MOBILE DEVICE</h4>
         <p>If you use the Services through your mobile device, we may receive a unique identifier or information about your location. You may at any time prevent the Services from using your location by turning this option off at the device level. When you use the Services through your mobile device, we also collect device type and UUID, a unique identifier generated within the Application, and store this information in log files and system databases. We use this information to provide you with the most up to date application and features, or to advertise or promote products or services to you that are applicable to your device type.</p>

         <h4>BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSFERS</h4>
         <p>If we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, ConsignItAway.com customer information (including personal information) will likely be shared for evaluation purposes and included among the transferred business assets. If an acquirer that has assumed all or part of our business materially alters how it uses or shares your personal information than at the time of initial collection, the acquirer will provide prior notice of the new or changed practice.</p>

         <h4>COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT</h4>
         <p>ConsignItAway.com cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect our rights or the rights of our users or others, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.</p>
